# The excel file

The excel "AAR_matrix.xlsx" will be the base for the database. This is the original data which, when finished should be uploaded to the SQL database. Then, in SQL additions and changes can be made and this file will become redundant.

The excel file is based on all national SRD's.

I think it is best to just all work in the "specifications sheet"
If you change the order of the sheets, which I recommend you not to do, make sure to also alter the "AAR_excel_to_SQL.py" file as this file directly reads the excel sheets and converts it to an SQL database. 

If you are working on one of the SRD's: please comment here. This way we can prevent people doing redundant work or ruining other work. Make sure that you know how far you are. Pherhaps it is also an idea, to first work in a seperate sheet and then add the complete sheet when you are sure that it is finished!
